### Course Overview:

This course will familiarize students with the central concepts of theoretical ecology, providing an underlying mathematical basis to the processes that govern natural systems. Emphasis will be placed on population and community ecology, exploring (mostly) discrete time models of population and community dynamics, with clear links to empirical data. 





### Course Goals:

Over the course, it is expected that students gain
* an understanding of theoretical concepts and their relationship to natural systems
* a confidence around applying analytical and simulation based approaches to ecological data
* an ability to read and understand primary literature

 --------|------| -----------
| **Item** | **Points** | **Total** |
| Assignments | 4 x 75 | 300 |
| Attendance/Participation | 50 | 50 |
| Paper summary | 50 | 50 |
| Final exam (or final project) | 100 | 100 |



**Graduate-level grading**

 {.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}

  <span></span>     | <span></span> | <span></span> 
 --------|------| -----------
| **Item** | **Points** | **Total** |
| Assignments | 4 x 50 | 200 |
| Attendance/Participation | 50 | 50 |
| Paper summary | 2 x 50 | 100 |
| Project | 100 | 100 |
| Final exam | 50 | 50 |






**Assignments**: 

All assignments are due by immediately before the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed. Assignments are not collaborative, and I expect that each student will complete the assignment independently. 



**Late Assignments**: 

All assignments are expected to be electronically submitted by the due date. I will not accept any assignment that is submitted after the deadline and the assignment will receive the grade of 0. This course is an upper-level class and you are expected to work at the appropriate level and be responsible for your work. All deadlines are posted with the syllabus or any changes will be announced ahead of time.










**Attendance**: 

Much of the material presented will not be available if you aren't in class to hear it. You should come to class. If you do not, you may struggle. Part of the class will be discussing relevant papers. If you do not participate in paper discussions, clearly demonstrating that you have read and understand the nuances of the work, this will affect your grade. Attendance and participation will be worth 50 points. 






**Paper summaries**:

The goal of the paper summary is to get you reading and understanding theory-heavy research published in peer-reviewed journals. I expect that these papers will dive deeper into some aspect of theoretical ecology that we covered in class, and could be tailored to your own personal interests. If you need help finding papers, do not hesitate to reach out. I really like the journal _Theoretical Ecology_, but you can find theory-heavy papers in many journals, including _Proceedings of the Royal Society B_, _American Naturalist_, and _PNAS_. These papers must include a model and be theory-heavy, meaning that it is not simply using a fancy statistical approach to a scientific question, but actually derive some of their results from an underlying theoretical model (we will cover the difference between statistical and phenomenological modeling in the first week, but feel free to send me a message for clarification). Undergraduates will do one of these paper summaries (about a page long, clearly presenting the question, methods, and results, paying attention to tying it into what we've learned in class). Graduate researchers will do two of these (1-2 pages, more detailed in terms of model insight and structure - read the supplemental material of the article, as I want you to know the article back to front).

**Project**: 

Graduate researchers in the course will do a course-long project. The project will be a demonstration of your learning and allow you to use the new tools and concepts you have acquired in the course. This could take many forms, including the analysis of a commonly used model in ecology, a review of some application of theory and empirical data (e.g., the theory of species-area relationships), and many others. It should be written as a report, with introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. It should contain relevant citations beyond simply citing the textbook, demonstrating that you have researched the topic. Ideally, the model exploration would be linked to a natural system, meaning that parameters and model structure could reflect natural systems. I am also open to theory-driven projects meant to explore dynamics outside of the realm of what natural systems might experience (e.g., examining how to incorporate environmental variability in population growth rates into demographic models). 

More information on the final project and its components are provided at the bottom of this document. The three core parts are 1) the proposal, 2) the implementation, and 3) the presentation

_The project is worth 100 points_








**Final exam**:

The final exam will be worth 50 points, consisting of a mixture of coding and high-level conceptual questions.

The final exam will be **Tuesday, May 2 - 4:00 pm**.








### Academic honesty

Cooperation has a limit. You should not copy your code or answers directly with other students. Feel free to discuss the problems with others, but write your own solutions. Penalties for cheating are severe -- they range from a zero grade for the assignment or exam up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense. Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

You are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and will result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, using another student's work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.

The first tenet of the Carolinian Creed is, "I will practice personal and academic integrity."



### Diversity and inclusion

The university is committed to a campus environment that is inclusive, safe, and respectful for all persons, and one that fully embraces the Carolinian Creed. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating the unique experiences, background, and point of view each student brings. You are expected at all times to apply the highest academic standards to this course and to treat others with dignity and respect.

### Accessibility, disability, and triggers 

I am committed to ensuring course accessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/) documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional triggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so that I can be aware in terms of course content.
