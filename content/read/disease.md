### If the course had a lab

Andreas Handel has done some nice work creating modules to explore infectious disease dynamics through R. If you are inclined, check out [the package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/articles/DSAIDE.html). It provides loads of things that we simply cannot go into, including the importance of fitting the models to empirical data to get estimates of important parameters.
